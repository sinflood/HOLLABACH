HOLLABACH is a language for composing MIDI based music. With HOLLABACH, composers can create compositions similar to writing programming code and utilize common programming tools and resources with their compositions. The language also includes support for loops and conditional logic for the often repetitive or algorithmic nature of musical compositions. HOLLABACH is designed to help composers create music efficiently, compose music collaboratively and abstract away the semantics of the MIDI specification.
